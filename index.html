              Recently there has been a new surge in developing machine learning applications in the analysis of medical imaging.<br>
              One common examples is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). <BR>
              CNNs have been trained to be able to analyze each individual voxel in a patient’s 3-Dimensional MRI scan to determine which areas of the image contain pathological findings (tumor, sclerosis, ischemia, etc.) and which do not.<br>
              Successful implementation of these type of algorithms will facilitate both faster and finer detection of dangerous diseases.</p>

            Created and compared six models based on our data.<BR>
            Models used were:<BR>
            Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K Neighbors, SVC, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Gaussian NB<BR>
            Stroke data with 43400 records, heart disease with 303 records, hepatitis with 305 records and Parkinsons disease with 195 records were used.<BR>
            Accuracy score for training and testing data was generated and best model for each disease was identified to predict the outcome. Learned what factors drive each prediction.<BR>
            Stroke data was truncated to 3260 and 434 records to study the effect of record size. Comparison plots were generated. Large data size(>10k) provided better results.<BR> 
            Stroke data with 4300 records was also used to study the effect of 10/90, 20/80, 30/70 and 40/60 split of dataset into test/train data. Comparison plots generated. &nbsp;<a href="stroke.html" target="_blank" class="button">Code</a>

              Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.<BR>
              The result? People are turned off. That’s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance.<BR>
              Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.<BR>
              By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, we can greatly impact public perception of the industry.
