           Recently there has been a new surge in developing machine learning applications in the analysis of medical imaging.<br>
           One common examples is the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). <BR>
           CNNs have been trained to be able to analyze each individual voxel in a patient’s 3-Dimensional MRI scan to determine which areas of the image contain pathological findings (tumor, sclerosis, ischemia, etc.) and which do not.<BR>
           Successful implementation of these type of algorithms will facilitate both faster and finer detection of dangerous diseases.</p>

              Customers provide extensive information to identify risk classification and eligibility, including scheduling medical exams, a process that takes an average of 30 days.<BR>
              The result? People are turned off. That’s why only 40% of U.S. households own individual life insurance.<BR>
              Prudential wants to make it quicker and less labor intensive for new and existing customers to get a quote while maintaining privacy boundaries.<BR>
              By developing a predictive model that accurately classifies risk using a more automated approach, we can greatly impact public perception of the industry.
