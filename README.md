Transforming Healthcare!

The purpose of this project was to analyze how machine learning and big data is changing healthcare industry. One way they’ve been able to accomplish this is by leveraging innovative machine learning (ML) algorithms that can operate without human intervention.

Some examples are:

        1. Machine Learning in the Rapid Detection of Cancer
        
        2. Machine Learning in the Discovery of New Drugs
        
        3. Machine Learning in Automatic Recommendation or Treatment or for diagnostic purpose.
        
        4. Monitoring Emerging infectious Diseases using data analytics.
